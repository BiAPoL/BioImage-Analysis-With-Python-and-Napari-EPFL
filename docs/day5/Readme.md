# Day 5: Best practices in scientific programming and licensing/sharing of code

In today's sessions, we start with a recap session ([slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day5/recap.pdf)). Then, we will dive into good scientific practice when writing, documenting and publishing code. We will learn about licensing materials such as code and data. In an extended exercise we will share code via a github repository with our neighbors. In the afternoon we will convert a Python function that analyzes some image data into a Napari plugin.
