# Day 3: Machine learning and introduction to deep learning

On day 3 we start with a recap session ([slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day3/recap.pdf)). 
We will segment nuclei and cells in images using machine learning and deep learning.
