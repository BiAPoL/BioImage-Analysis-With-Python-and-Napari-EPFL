# Day 2: Image Filtering, Segmentation and Feature Extraction

On day 2 we start with a recap session ([slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day2/recap_day1.pdf)). We  will then process images using filters for denoising and background removal. 
We will also segment nuclei and cells in images using classical approaches, machine learning and deep learning.
Last but not least we will extract quantitative measurements from images.
