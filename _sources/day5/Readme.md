# Day 5: Surfaces and bring your own data

On this (last) day, we start with a recap of the previous day (theory on clustering & dimensionality reduction) as well as licensing, rights and permissions ([Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/blob/main/docs/day5/Recap_day_4.pdf)).

The rest of the day will focus around working with points, surfaces and your own data. Enjoy!
